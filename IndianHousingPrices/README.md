### Overview
In this Project, I analyzed the factors affecting the Price of Houses in Top-tier Metropolitan cities of India, i.e. Bangalore, Delhi & Mumbai.

### Dataset
The Dataset comprises data that was scraped. It includes:
- Collection of Prices of **New** and **Resale** houses located in the Metropolitan areas of India 
- The amenities provided for each house

üìå **Note:** *Since for a set of houses, nothing was mentioned about certain amenities, `9` was used to mark such values, which could indicate the absence of information about the apartment but these values don't ascertain the absence of such a feature in real life.*

### Installations
For some of the technology to be used in the Python Notebook file, needs to be installed, so refer to their respective Documentation. For eg,

```python
pip install geopy
```

### Conclusion
After the complete analysis, as per the code in `ipynb` file, Final Conclusion Statement is as follows,

**Fresh Houses in Outskirts of the City, having Important Amenities like, Gym, Clubhouse, 24*7Security, PowerBackup, CarParking and not having Nearby Hospitals & Schools are more expensive.
Also if a Family is planning to Purchase a 4 or 5 Bedroom House, then they might have their own furnitures, due to which they want Houses Non-Furnished, and Unfurnished Houses are expensive. 
Alternatively, if a small family or bachelors are planning to purchase a House then they require Furnished Houses.
Anyone who is eligible to spend more money to purchase a house, they will get more number of bedrooms and more area, and vice-versa.**
