### Overview
In this Project, I analyzed the factors affecting the Price of Houses in Top-tier Metropolitan cities of India, i.e. Bangalore, Delhi & Mumbai.

### Dataset
The Dataset comprises data that was scraped. It includes:
- Collection of Prices of **New** and **Resale** houses located in the Metropolitan areas of India 
- The amenities provided for each house

ðŸ“Œ **Note:** *Since for a set of houses, nothing was mentioned about certain amenities, `9` was used to mark such values, which could indicate the absence of information about the apartment but these values don't ascertain the absence of such a feature in real life.*
